Thank you for choosing REXSpeeder!

You can build the library yourself (recommended), use the library I've precompiled (Windows only), or simply include the sources with your project.

BUILDING: LINUX, OS X (CMake)
================================

CMake support is included in the "cmake" directory. You will need to have zlib installed on your development platform.

To build on a *NIX the first time:

1. Go to the project root.
2. mkdir build (to create a build directory)
3. cd build (enter the directory)
4. cmake -g"Unix Makefiles" ../cmake

Once that is done, simply type "make" inside your "build" folder. The will build the rexspeeder library for your platform. You can then copy it to your project's dependencies folder, link to it with -lrexspeeder (or equivalent), and include REXSpeeder.h. Alternatively, include this as a target in your cmake file.

BUILDING: WINDOWS (Visual Studio)
=================================

I've included a library file for win32 builds under include/REXSpeeder.lib. If you'd like to compile the library yourself, here's how to do it with Visual Studio:
	
	1. You will need to direct the solution to a copy of the zlib compression library. REXSpeeder is known to work with zlib 1.2.8. You can get this from http://www.zlib.net/. You want the "compiled DLL" version. Download it and extract it to some directory. 
			
	2. Tell the Visual Studio project where the zlib library is:
			
		1. Open REXSpeeder.sln in the "VisualStudio" directory.
			
		2. From Visual Studio, under "Solution Explorer", right click on REXSpeeder and at the bottom of the menu click "Properties". (I.e., go to your project's "Property Pages".)
			1. Navigate to C/C++ -> General
			   You'll see that Additional Include Directories is set to:
			
				"C:\Development\Libs\zlib128-dll\include;..\include;%(AdditionalIncludeDirectories)"
					
			   Change this to:
			
				"$(YourZlibDirectory)\zlib128-dll\include;..\include;%(AdditionalIncludeDirectories)",
				
				where $(YourZlibDirectory) is replaced with the directory you extracted zlib to.
			
			3. Navigate to Librarian -> General
			   You'll see that Additional Library Directores is set to:
						
				"C:\Development\Libs\zlib128-dll\lib;%(AdditionalLibraryDirectories)".
						
				Change this to:
				
				"$(YourZlibDirectory)\zlib128-dll\lib;%(AdditionalLibraryDirectories)".
			
	3. From the "Build" menu at the top of the screen, select Build Solution. REXSpeeder.lib will be built in the "include" directory.
			
	
INCLUDING REXSPEEDER AS A LIBRARY (Visual Studio)
=================================================

You need to reference REXSpeeder.lib and REXSpeeder.h in your project in order to use REXSpeeder. See example\example.vcxproj for an example in Visual Studio, or follow along:

For Visual Studio, you'll follow the same process of modifying your project's properties as outline above:
	1. Under C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories, add "$(YourREXSpeederDirectory)\include".
	2. Under Additional Library Directories, add "$(YourREXSpeederDirectory)\include".
	3. Under Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies, add "REXSpeeder.lib".
	
If you are getting strange errors trying to build a project that's referencing the .lib file I've given you, try building the library yourself.

(Also, a word of advice: The Property Pages dialogue in Visual Studio is a huge nuisance. Learn how to change the values in <project_name>.vcxproj by hand. It's just an XML file.)
	
JUST LET ME INCLUDE THE REXSPEEDER SOURCES DARNIT WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO BE SO COMPLICATED
=========================================================================================

The header file's under the "include" directory, and the source file is under the "src" directory. Grab 'em and drop 'em in your project. Done!

You'll probably end up recompiling them a lot though :(

And they'll be optimized (or not) the same way the rest of your project is optimized :( :(
